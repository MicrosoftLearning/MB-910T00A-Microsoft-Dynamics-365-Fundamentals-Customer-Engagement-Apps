Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Dynamics 365 Marketing
========================

## Practice Lab 1.1 - Work with customer engagement apps 

## Objectives

During this exercise, you will first log into the environment. Then you can see that it is very easy to access the different Dynamics 365 applications available to you directly from the **Home** screen. Once you have opened an app, you can easily switch between the different applications as required. Accessing and using the basic functionality in Dynamics 365 applications is something you as a user will do daily.


## Lab Setup

  - **Estimated Time**: 30 minutes

## Instructions

**Task 1 – Log into the Power Platform admin center**

1. Access https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com and log in with your user credentials.

2. Record your user credential up to the @ symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization.

Important: Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., mollyc) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but do not make any changes.

**Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application**

1. Access https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments.

2. Select the WWLLABnnn environment, where nnn is a number. This is the shared Dynamics 365 environment where you will be performing all labs.

3. Click Open environment

4. Expand the App Launcher domino button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of Power Platform admin center. Select the Dynamics 365 Marketing app to launch it.

5. Explore the navigation pane on the left hand side. The button on the bottom of the pane allows you to change areas. You are currently viewing the Marketing area.

6. Select **Marketing** at the botton of the navigation pane and select the **Events** area. Explore the **Events** area of the navigation pane.

7. Spend a few minutes exploring the application and then return to the Marketing area.

**Task 3 – Work with customer engagement apps**

In this exercise, you will become familiar with how to access the different Dynamics 365 customer engagement applications by leveraging the Microsoft Office 365 apps screen.

1.	In a web browser, navigate to https://www.office.com/apps. All the applications that you have access to will be displayed.   

2.	Select the **Business Apps** tab to limit the applications that are being displayed to only show Dynamics 365 business applications.   

3.	To reduce the number of applications being displayed, select the **Search** field located at the top screen. 
 
4.	Type the text **Sales Hub** and select the **Sales Hub** app to open it.   

5. When you are within an app, there will be different areas that you can work with based on what you are trying to do. For example, the Sales Hub application contains different administrative settings that you can work with. 

6. On the lower left side of the screen, select the text **Sales**, from the list that appears, select **App Settings**.  This part of the application is where you can make administrative changes to it.  

7. Select the Area selector again and change it from **App Settings** back to **Sales**.

8. If you want to switch from the Sales app to a different app such as Customer Service hub, select the **Sales Hub** text in the upper left part of the screen next to the text Dynamic 365. 

9. The Apps screen will appear, select **Customer Service Hub** and you will be taken to the Customer Service Hub Application. 

10. Select the **Customer Service Hub** text at the top to switch back to the **Sales Hub** App.
