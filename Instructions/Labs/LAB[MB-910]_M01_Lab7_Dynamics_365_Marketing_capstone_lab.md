Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Dynamics 365 Marketing
========================

## Practice Lab 1.7 - Dynamics 365 Marketing capstone lab

**Note:** Marketing Emails cannot be created or edited in Internet Explorer. Please use Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome to complete this exercise.

## Lab Scenario

ABC company specializes in the manufacturing, selling, installation and servicing of security equipment. Their products include both indoor and outdoor security cameras, moisture and fire sensors, monitoring services, and more. 

ABC company uses Dynamics 365 applications to engage with all their customers across different areas of their organization from sales to service. 

**Sales and Marketing**

ABC Company markets to their residential customers directly through targeted marketing campaigns. Customers are targeted based on their city, and other factors. Marketing materials are sent through email and based on their interaction with the email are guided accordingly. 

While some of their smaller products are sold through retailers, most products are sold direct to consumers by their internal sale staff.

Internally, they focus on two key areas: 

- **Residential Customers:** Residential customers are typically looking for either individual components, or to buy a whole home solution. These sales cycles are typically shorter and originate from social media, websites, referrals, or direct contact from the prospect. Since residential customers are typically more focused on specific products or smaller installs, their sales cycles typically last a few days or weeks. 

- **Enterprise Customers:** Enterprise sellers focus on customers who need a more specialized and tailored business solutions. Enterprise sales typically span multiple locations with linked communication, and often require multiple resources to complete the project. These sales cycles are typically longer and have many more moving parts. 

It is important that all of ABC company’s sellers have the tools, resources, and guidance necessary regardless of their focus area while selling to their customers. 

**System Installation:**

The installation process for purchased security equipment varies based on the type of customer that was sold. 

- **Residential Customers:** Since residential installs typically take less than a day, they are done by internal employees. After the sale is made, a work order is created, and a qualified technician is identified and scheduled to perform the install. 

- **Enterprise Customers:** Enterprise deploys can take months, and require a project manager to oversee the day-to-day operations. This includes creating project plans, defining project teams, and scheduling resources. 

**Service and Support:**

Once the systems are installed, ABC Company provides support after the sale. If a customer has an issue, they can contact customer support. An agent will attempt to work with the customer remotely to resolve their issue. If their issue cannot be resolved remotely, the support agent can escalate the issue to a work order that will be scheduled and worked on by a qualified field technician. 

## Objectives

ABC Company markets to their residential customers directly through targeted marketing campaigns. Customers are targeted based on their city, and other factors. Marketing materials are sent through email and based on their interaction with the email are guided accordingly. 

A recent marketing campaign targeting homeowners in Portland led to a lot of new leads. ABC Company was able to convert many those leads into sales revenue. You have been asked to do something similar in the Seattle area. 

Upon completion of the lab, you will have completed the following:

- Create a customized marketing email.

- Create a dynamic customer segment.

- Create a Customer Journey that leverages your marketing email and customer segment.

	- **Address 1 Zip/Postal:** 98001

	- **Address 1 Zip/Postal:** 98001

**NOTE:** We are using the same address information, to make it easy to recognize the contacts as sample data. 

### Task 2: Create a Customer Segment

Creating a customer segment will let us define the customers that we want to target different marketing actions towards. 

1. Using the navigation on the left, select **Segments** under the **Customers** group. 

2. On the command bar, select **New**.

3. Since we had the membership to change as contacts are added, removed, or edited, we will select **New Dynamic Segment** from the menu that appears. 

4. In the **Segment Templates** dialog box that opens, select **Skip** to close it and continue to the **New Segment** screen.

5. After the new record opens, select the drop-down arrow next to the **Status reason** field in the record header at the top. 

6. In the **Name** field enter **Seattle Customers – Your Initials**. 

7. In the segment definition window, select **Add query block**.

8. Notice that the Contact table is selected by default. Do not Change it. 

9. Click to select the ghost text **Select attribute**. 

10. Enter the word City to filter the list. Choose **Address 1: City** from the list.

14. Select **Go Live** to publish the segment.

15. Wait for about a minute and then select **Refresh** on the command bar to refresh the page. 

16. You should now see that a **Members** tab has been added.

### Task 3: Test your Customer Segment

Now that we have successfully created your segment, let’s verify the dynamics segment will populate correctly as contacts are added or removed. To do this we will create a new contact who lives in Seattle. 

1. Using the navigation on the left, select **Contacts** under the Customers Group

2. On the command bar, select **New**.

3. Complete the **New Contact** page as follows.

	- **First Name**: Rick

	- **Last Name**: Jones – Your Initials

	- **Email**: Enter an email address that you can receive mail from.

	- **Address 1 Street 1:** 1989 191<sup data-htmlnode="">st</sup> Ave N

	- **Address 1: City**: Seattle

	- **Address 1 State:** WA

	- **Address 1 Zip/Postal:** 98001

4. Once you have completed the contact, select **Save &amp; Close**.

5. Using the navigation on the left, select **Segments** under the **Customers** group. 

6. Open the **Seattle Customers – Your Initials** segment you created earlier. 

7. Select the **Members** tab. Notice that **Rick Jones – Your Initials** should now be present. You may need to refresh the view.

**IMPORTANT:** Since we are working a shared environment and everyone is working in the same system, you will likely see other Contacts in the Dynamic Marketing segment as well. That is OK for purposes of this course.

5. Click in the segment look up below the **Inclusion** drop-down. 

6. Enter the text **Seattle** and select the **Seattle Customers** segment you created earlier. 

7. On the design canvas, move your cursor between **Start** and **End**. Select the **+** sign, from the menu that appears, select **Send an email**.
