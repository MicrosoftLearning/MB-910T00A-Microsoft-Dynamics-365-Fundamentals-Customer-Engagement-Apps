========================

## Practice Lab 1.6 - Create a simple Customer Journey

## Objectives

During this exercise you will see that Customer Journeys are a key component in Dynamics 365 Marketing. You will create customer journeys as a basis for any marketing effort to guide the path a customer takes while interacting with your organization's marketing process. The goal of the journey, when it is complete, is to turn them into revenue.
