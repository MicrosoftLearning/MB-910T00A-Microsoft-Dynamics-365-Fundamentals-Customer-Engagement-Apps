========================

## Practice Lab 1.2 - Work with customer engagement apps 

## Lab scenario

## Objectives

During this exercise, you will see that it is very easy to access the different Dynamics 365 applications available to you directly from the Home screen. Once you have opened an app, you can easily switch between the different applications as required. Accessing and using the basic functionality in Dynamics 365 applications is something you as a user will do daily.


## Lab Setup

  - **Estimated Time**: 10 minutes

## Instructions

In this exercise, you will become familiar with how to access the different Dynamics 365 Customer engagement applications by using the Dynamics 365 Home screen. 

1. In a web browser, navigate to [**https://home.dynamics.com**](https://home.dynamics.com/)**.** All the applications that you have access to will be displayed. 

2. To reduce the number of applications being displayed, select the **Filter Icon** located next to the Get more apps button. 

3. Under **BY INSTANCE NAME**, select **NONE**. And choose the Environment that you want to leverage. 

4. Select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner of the **Filter box** to close the filter box.

6. Type the text **Sales Hub** and select the **Sales Hub** app to open it. 

7. When you are within an app, there will be different areas that you can work with based on what you are trying to do. For example, the Sales Hub application contains different administrative settings that you can work with. 

8. On the lower left side of the screen, select the text **Sales**, from the list that appears, select **App Settings.** This part of the application is where you can make administrative changes to it. 

9. Select the Area selector again and change it from **App Settings** back to **Sales**.

10. If you want to switch from the Sales app to a different app such as Customer Service hub, select the **Sales Hub** text in the upper left part of the screen next to the text Dynamic 365. 

11. The Apps screen will appear, select **Customer Service Hub** and you will be taken to the Customer Service Hub Application.
