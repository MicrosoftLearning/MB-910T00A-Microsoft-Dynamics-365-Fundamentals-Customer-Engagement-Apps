Module 1: Learn the Fundamentals of Dynamics 365 Marketing
========================

## Practice Lab 1.1 - Validate lab environment 

In this lab, you will validate that your classroom tenant is working as expected. You will access your individual credentials, record your “alias”, and open the Dynamics 365 model-driven application that we will be using throughout the course. 

**Important Note:** This lab will provide you with an actual Dynamics 365 tenant
and licenses for the Power Platform applications you will be using in this
course. Please be aware that the Power Platform is evolving all the time. The
instructions in this document may be different from what you experience in your
actual tenant. It is also possible to experience a delay of several
minutes before the virtual machine has network connectivity to begin the labs.

Exercise 1 - Access the Dynamics 365 application
---------------------------------------------------

### Task 1 – Log into the Power Platform admin center

1.  Access <https://admin.Powerplatform.microsoft.com> and log in with your user credentials.

2. Record your user credential up to the **@** symbol on a scratch piece of paper or in Notepad. This will be your lab alias that you will use to differentiate the data you create within the shared Dynamics 365 organization. 

**Important:** Please be aware that this tenant and the Dynamics 365 organization will be shared with the other students in your classroom, like employees would share a tenant when using the Dynamics 365 instance belonging to their organization. Do not use any PII (personally identifiable information) when creating records. It is also good practice to use your username prefix (ex., **mollyc**) in front of all records, data, apps, flows, etc. you create.

3. Feel free to explore the Power Platform admin center but **do not make any changes**.

### Task 2 – Access the Dynamics 365 application

1.  Expand the App Launcher domino button at the top left of the screen, directly to the left of **Power Platform admin center. Click on the Dynamics 365 **Marketing** app to launch it.

2.  Explore the navigation pane on the left hand side. The button on the bottom of the pane allows you to change areas. You are currently viewing the **Marketing** area. 

3.  Click **Marketing** at the botton of the navigation pane and select the **Events** area. Explore the **Events** area of the navigation pane.  

4. Spend a few minutes exploring the application and then return to the **Marketing** area.
